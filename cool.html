    <p>Double, double toil and trouble;
      <br>
      Fire burn and caldron bubble.
      <br>
      Fillet of a fenny snake,
      <br>
      In the caldron boil and bake;
      <br>
      Eye of newt and toe of frog,
      <br>
      Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
      <br>
      Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
      <br>
      Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
      <br>
      For a charm of powerful trouble,
      <br>
      Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
      <br>

      Double, double toil and trouble;
      <br>
      Fire burn and caldron bubble.
      <br>
      Cool it with a baboon's blood,
      <br>
      Then the charm is firm and good.
